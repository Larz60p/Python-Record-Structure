# Python-Record-Structure
## File Record Format for Python (3.4) using JSON and collections.namedtuple

**Caveat's:** This code was written on MS windows 7 pro. It should run without modification in Linux, but since my Linux box is currently down, hasn't been tested on that OS nor has it been tested on OS-X.

**Goal:** To build a file record format, for immutable data (once written), that would be transferable between python and other computer languages (JSON format). Allow for python names like:

**```stkmktrec.dbtabledesc```**
**```stkmktrec.columns[0].db_column_name```**

1 - Be Textual, allowing for human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner

2 - Be simple to design, read and write

3 - Be easily converted to an existing built-in python data type

4 - Be self-documenting so that reading the python script would immediately indicate what the data element was.

Solutions:
  1 Be Textual and use a format understood by other non-python programs. This was easy, JSON already exists and is ready as is.

  2 Be simple to design, read and write – Again easy using a python dictionary structure, in combination with python list for the repeated parts of a record design.

  3, 4  Be easily converted to an existing built-in python data type. Reading JSON into a python collections named tuple is clean, simple, and elegant. This also satisfies the self-documentation requirement, as will be seen below.

Here's a sample of how used:

**To read data:**
```
class ShowData:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rec = Record.Record(filename)
        myrec = self.rec.record
```

**To display parts of the record:**

```
        keys = stkrec._asdict().keys()
        print('\nKeys:')
        for key in keys:
            print('\nkey: {}'.format(key))
            thisrec = getattr(stkrec, key)
            print('filename: {}'.format(thisrec.filename))
            print('number of columns: {}'.format(len(thisrec.columns)))
            print('column 0 column name: {}'.format(thisrec.columns[0].db_column_name))
```

Results in:
```
Keys:

key: nasdaqlisted
filename: nasdaqlisted.txt
number of columns: 8
column 0 column name: Symbol

key: ASXListedCompanies
filename: ASXListedCompanies.csv
number of columns: 3
column 0 column name: CompanyName

```

The sample file can be regenerated by running WriteRecord.py
It contains two records for stock market data as shown below:

The class contains iter types so that:
```
for rec in stkrec:
    ...
```

is valid

The only module needed to use is Record.py.

The other python scripts are for creating data and example only.

The JSON file can be created by web form or whatever.
